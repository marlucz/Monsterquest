## Done

- Refactor to React,
- components functionality,
- styles checked on browsterstack and physical devices,
- change Stateful Components into Functional Components with Hooks,
- refactor application to use Context instead of passing props, might be a little overkill though... but it is for learning purposes'

## What I've learned

- React!,
- state management and conditional rendering techniques,
- git --amend ftw,
- not to be afraid of changing technology that I already know for the purposes of learning new things

## What's more that could be done

- Make a card game based on monster's statistics
- refactor styling to CSSModules or Styled Components,
- get better DRY architecture,
- add some microinteractions
